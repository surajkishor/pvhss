         at Dimapur and a boarding School named Pranab Vidyapith at Bokajan. He with his co-workers and well-wishers initiated the materilisation of the relief activities,
          medical services and other welfare activities of the Sangha.Upto 2000 all these welfare activities were carried out under the banner of Dimapur Hindu Milan Mandir. 
         In the year 2000, the Dimapur Hindu Milan Mandir which was an affiliated branch of the Bharat Sevashram Sangha, 
         was transited to Bharat Sevashrsm Sangha, Dimapur Branch. 17th January,
         1984 was a red letter day in the history of Pranab Vidyapith. It was on that auspicious day of Pous Purnima in 1984, the Vidyapith came to its existance. 
         The School starts its humble beginning under the holy banner of Hindu Milan Mandir with 145 students on roll and with 6 teachers in the present Mandir Premises. 
         Later on in 1985 it was shifted to the present site in a Thatched house. 
        The Vidyapith was recognised by Nagaland Board of School Education,
         Kohima in 1986 for its excellent results in its maiden appearance in H.S.L.C. Examination in 1985.
